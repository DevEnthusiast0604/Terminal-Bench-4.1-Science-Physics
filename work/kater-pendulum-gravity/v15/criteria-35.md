## Verifier

| # | Criterion | Outcome | Method | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `verifiable` | **PASS** | code+model | Grading deterministically executes the submission and compares its complete JSON output with fixed numerical references, uses preinstalled tooling, and has agreeing oracle and regrade records. |
| 2 | `outcome_verified` | **PASS** | code+model | The tests judge numerical results and the output interface without requiring the reference solution's clock reconstruction, camera calibration, or period-estimation method. |
| 3 | `functional_verification` | **PASS** | code+model | The verifier runs the submitted program on four staged sessions and checks its actual exit status and captured output rather than inspecting source keywords or trusting reported success. |
| 4 | `verification_explanation_quality` | **PASS** | code+model | The README explains the output checks, generating ground truth, execution limits, and tolerance calibration against several reductions, including an independently implemented equation-of-motion fit. |
| 5 | `binary_reward` | **PASS** | code+model | The verifier initially writes reward 0 and reaches its final reward writes only through finish calls with literal 0 or 1, while infrastructure failures remove the reward. |

## Oracle

| # | Criterion | Outcome | Method | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | `solvable` | **PASS** | code+model | The recorded oracle passes under the declared constraints, and its compact numerical reduction is reasonably implementable in a few hours once the estimator design and physical interpretation are known. |
| 7 | `solution_quality` | **PASS** | code+model | The oracle computes geometry, time calibration, pivot assignments, camera parameters, periods, gravity, gyration radius, and release amplitudes from the supplied session, with the implementation maintained in a separate source file. |
| 8 | `solution_explanation_quality` | **PASS** | code+model | The README explains why swing consistency identifies pivots and calibrates the camera, and why the two physical-pendulum relations determine gravity and gyration radius, consistently with the oracle. |

## Difficulty

| # | Criterion | Outcome | Method | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 9 | `difficult` | **PASS** | code+model | Reconciling unreliable pivot records, rolling-contact mechanics, an uncalibrated oblique projection, and interrupted camera timing requires genuine experimental metrology and nonlinear estimation expertise. |
| 10 | `essential_difficulty` | **PASS** | code+model | The challenge is identifying and correcting physical and instrumental effects, while the small JSON interface and tolerances supported by alternative estimators avoid making clerical precision the core difficulty. |
| 11 | `difficulty_explanation_quality` | **PASS** | code+model | The README describes the synthetic instrument model, realistic laboratory users, and specific physical and evidential ambiguities without substituting model performance for intrinsic difficulty. |
| 12 | `expert_time_estimate` | **PASS** | code+model | The matching ten-hour estimates in task.toml and the README are plausible for designing and validating this multi-effect unattended laboratory reduction and are distinct from its execution limit. |

## Safety

| # | Criterion | Outcome | Method | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 13 | `anti_cheat_robustness` | **PASS** | code+model | Answers and grading code are confined to the separate verifier, submission execution cannot access them or the reward channel, and the reported targeted daemon-based reward forgery executed and scored 0. |
| 14 | `task_security` | **PASS** | code+model | The executable assets contain scoped container setup, numerical computation, and verification operations without exfiltration or host access, and the bounded forgery payload is an explicitly documented negative security control. |
| 15 | `verifier_execution_isolation` | **PASS** | code+model | Submitted code runs as uid 1500 after the reward directories are locked, root judges captured output without importing the submission, and cleanup kills runner processes by uid with bounded pipe draining. |
| 16 | `do_not_modify_enforced` | **PASS** | code+model | The promised read-only session and working directory are root-owned and non-writable to the runner, with staged input paths, modes, and contents additionally checked before and after execution. |

## Reproducibility

| # | Criterion | Outcome | Method | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 17 | `deterministic_reproducible` | **PASS** | code+model | Both images use digest-pinned bases and pinned Python packages, grading uses fixed baked sessions without live services, and the supplied oracle and verifier-repeat records agree. |
| 18 | `separate_verifier_configured` | **PASS** | code+model | All submission inputs arrive through the declared archive, fixed cases and answers are baked into the verifier, tooling is preinstalled, and the shared Python runtime versions match across images. |
| 19 | `environment_hygiene` | **PASS** | code+model | The agent image contains task data and supported analysis libraries but no tests or oracle, while the verifier owns pytest and reporting tooling and both images correctly update, install, and clean apt metadata. |
| 20 | `resource_configuration` | **PASS** | code+model | The 28800-second agent budget matches the instruction, and the bounded reduction, successful constrained oracle, 600-second session limits, and 3000-second aggregate verifier allowance support the modest CPU and memory allocation. |
| 21 | `artifact_efficiency` | **NOT_APPLICABLE** | code+model (model) | The intended answer artifact is a single small agent-produced Python source file, with no large editable baseline or fixed input tree requiring transfer. |

## Specification

| # | Criterion | Outcome | Method | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 22 | `test_instruction_alignment` | **FAIL** | code+model (model) | instruction.md requires reduce.py to be a regular file, but the `if m.isdir():` branch in tests/tb4judge.py::unpack accepts a directory at that declared path and its contents. tests/emit.py then invokes `python3 reduce.py`, which can execute a directory containing __main__.py, and tests/test_outputs.py checks only the resulting behavior. A directory submission implementing the reduction could therefore pass all six tests while violating the explicit artifact-type requirement. Evidence: instruction.md: "`/app/output/reduce.py` must be a regular file, not a link, of at most 20971520 bytes"; tests/tb4judge.py: "if m.isdir():\n                os.makedirs(path, mode=0o755, exist_ok=True)\n                continue"; tests/emit.py: '"h1": ["reduce.py", "{case_dir}"]' |
| 23 | `instruction_concision` | **PASS** | code+model | The instruction states the laboratory situation, anchored deliverable and input paths, exact outcomes, and necessary checker-runtime contract without prescribing a reduction procedure or adding narrative fluff. |
| 24 | `structured_data_schema` | **PASS** | code+model | The instruction normatively specifies exactly five top-level JSON members, the a/b period members, session-derived run keys, numerical types, units, and the meaning of every quantity. |
| 25 | `typos` | **PASS** | code+model | The deliverable name, session layout, CLI invocation, JSON identifiers, and runtime paths agree across the instruction, solution, image setup, emitter, and judge. |

## Package

| # | Criterion | Outcome | Method | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 26 | `reviewable` | **PASS** | code+model | The README supplies physical interpretation and data provenance, while generate.py transparently derives the reference periods from chosen synthetic physical parameters independently of the reduction implementation. |
| 27 | `category_and_tags` | **PASS** | code+model | Science/Physics accurately identifies the primary domain, and the matching metadata tags specifically describe pendulum gravimetry, camera and time-base calibration, rolling pivots, and record validation. |
| 28 | `task_name` | **PASS** | code+model | kater-pendulum-gravity is a descriptive lowercase kebab-case slug with three words and matches the terminal-bench task name. |
| 29 | `task_readme` | **PASS** | code+model | The README contains all required reviewer-facing sections and provides useful physical, implementation, verification, provenance, and estimator-comparison context rather than merely duplicating the instruction. |
| 30 | `task_toml_schema` | **PASS** | code | all 24 checks pass or do not apply (24 decided by code, 0 by the model) |
| 31 | `no_extraneous_files` | **PASS** | code+model | The supplied assets serve environment construction, public examples, hidden grading sessions, oracle execution, tolerance derivation, reporting, or the documented targeted security control, with no apparent scratch artifacts. |
| 32 | `ctrf_reporting` | **PASS** | code+model | The root pytest invocation emits CTRF, copies it to /logs/verifier/ctrf.json, requires all six graded tests to pass, and supplies a failed-test stub for early grading exits. |

## Realism

| # | Criterion | Outcome | Method | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 33 | `interesting` | **PASS** | code+model | An unattended reduction that accounts for instrument calibration and inconsistent laboratory records has credible professional utility in experimental gravimetry and metrology despite the niche apparatus. |

## Novelty

| # | Criterion | Outcome | Method | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 34 | `novel` | **NOT_PROVIDED** | code (originality) | evidence not provided: originality: deferred to the full review: the quick check does not search originality (the full review runs tb4 originality and judges novel) |

## Agentic

| # | Criterion | Outcome | Method | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 35 | `agentic` | **PASS** | code+model | Developing the reduction requires inspecting session records and instrument logs, diagnosing interacting timing and projection effects, implementing estimators, and iteratively validating behavior on the example sessions. |

## Structured review

Methods: 2 by code, 33 by one model question with code checks, 0 by one model question. A code check fails a criterion only on present, current evidence; a check without its record is not provided (the model's verdict stands). A code verdict is never the model's.

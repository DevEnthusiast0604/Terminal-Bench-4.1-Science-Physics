## Verifier

| # | Criterion | Outcome | Method | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `verifiable` | **PASS** | code+model | The verifier executes ten bounded cases and objectively checks complete JSON outputs against numerical references, with preinstalled tooling and passing oracle/regrade control records. |
| 2 | `outcome_verified` | **PASS** | code+model | The instruction specifies physical results and a runtime interface, while grading imposes no particular numerical algorithm, editor, or development procedure. |
| 3 | `functional_verification` | **PASS** | code+model | The submitted program is actually executed, and its exit status, output schema, and forty numerical results are checked rather than inferred from source keywords. |
| 4 | `verification_explanation_quality` | **PASS** | code+model | The README explains every graded check and supports the tolerances with tighter computations, alternative ODE integration, analytical limiting cases, and convergence evidence well below the acceptance bounds. |
| 5 | `binary_reward` | **PASS** | code+model | The verifier initially writes zero and reaches reward one only after all required tests pass; every reachable verifier reward write is binary. |

## Oracle

| # | Criterion | Outcome | Method | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | `solvable` | **PASS** | code+model | The supplied oracle performs the required computation and passed the recorded verifier run, and its roughly 900-line implementation is credible for a specialist implementing a known approach in a focused working day. |
| 7 | `solution_quality` | **PASS** | code+model | The oracle derives outputs from quantum scattering, resonance integration, collision brackets, and linear solves, with its substantial source maintained separately from the short installation script. |
| 8 | `solution_explanation_quality` | **PASS** | code+model | The solution explanation accurately connects the physical specification to the oracle's phase shifts, resonance-aware integration, and converged transport equations, explaining why ordinary energy sampling is insufficient. |

## Difficulty

| # | Criterion | Outcome | Method | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 9 | `difficult` | **PASS** | code+model | Resolving quantum shape resonances and constructing high-order binary-mixture Chapman-Enskog brackets requires genuine specialist expertise beyond a routine numerical course project. |
| 10 | `essential_difficulty` | **PASS** | code+model | The documented failures of naive integration arise from missed resonances and coefficient convergence, while the simple four-number output contract and calibrated tolerances do not create a clerical challenge. |
| 11 | `difficulty_explanation_quality` | **PASS** | code+model | The README identifies specific intrinsic numerical and physical difficulties, explains the model-derived origin of the values, and names thermophysical-property specialists as the professional users without relying on model scores. |
| 12 | `expert_time_estimate` | **PASS** | code+model | The nonzero eight-hour estimate agrees across metadata and README and is plausible as a best-case specialist estimate for this substantial scientific implementation. |

## Safety

| # | Criterion | Outcome | Method | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 13 | `anti_cheat_robustness` | **PASS** | code+model | The agent image contains no answers or oracle, only the declared submission enters the separate verifier, and root-only answers and reward handling defeated the recorded detached reward-forging payload. |
| 14 | `task_security` | **PASS** | code+model | The supplied assets contain legitimate scientific computation and container-scoped verification operations, with the explicitly documented, bounded forgery fixture serving a targeted isolation test rather than exfiltration or host interference. |
| 15 | `verifier_execution_isolation` | **PASS** | code+model | All submitted code runs as uid 1500 after reward protection, while a fresh root judge only parses observations and uid-wide cleanup removes descendants, including processes escaping their original process group. |
| 16 | `do_not_modify_enforced` | **PASS** | code+model | The instruction's read-only working-folder constraint is enforced by a root-owned unpacked deliverable and unprivileged execution, so modifying that protected runtime copy cannot provide an advantageous shortcut. |

## Reproducibility

| # | Criterion | Outcome | Method | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 17 | `deterministic_reproducible` | **PASS** | code+model | Digest-pinned images, matching pinned numerical dependencies, fixed cases and references, and deterministic computation support reproducibility, consistent with the recorded passing regrades. |
| 18 | `separate_verifier_configured` | **PASS** | code+model | The checksummed submission is declared as the sole transferred input, all judging assets and tooling are baked into the verifier, and shared numerical dependency versions match the agent environment. |
| 19 | `environment_hygiene` | **PASS** | code+model | The agent image has only runtime and terminal dependencies, the verifier owns pytest and grading assets, and both Dockerfiles update, install, and clean apt without version-pinning apt packages. |
| 20 | `resource_configuration` | **PASS** | code+model | The declared two CPUs and 4 GB match the runtime contract and oracle parallelism, the 28800-second agent budget is consistent, and the verifier budget accommodates all ten 600-second case limits. |
| 21 | `artifact_efficiency` | **NOT_APPLICABLE** | code+model (model) | The answer is a single small agent-produced Python source file with no fixed source baseline or dependency tree that needs differential transfer. |

## Specification

| # | Criterion | Outcome | Method | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 22 | `test_instruction_alignment` | **PASS** | code+model | The numerical, schema, file-type, size, runtime, environment, and cleanup checks correspond to the stated contract, and the requirement map connects the physical definitions to the four output comparisons without introducing an algorithm requirement. |
| 23 | `instruction_concision` | **PASS** | code+model | The instruction is lengthy but confines itself to necessary physical conventions and the isolated runtime contract, names the deliverable absolutely, and supplies no numerical solution procedure or unnecessary roleplay. |
| 24 | `structured_data_schema` | **PASS** | code+model | The instruction normatively requires exactly one JSON object with exactly four explicitly named numeric members and defines the physical meaning and units of each. |
| 25 | `typos` | **PASS** | code+model | The deliverable path, invocation, argument order, output member names, and referenced computation files agree across instruction, oracle, harness, and README. |

## Package

| # | Criterion | Outcome | Method | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 26 | `reviewable` | **PASS** | code+model | The specialized expected values have an inspectable generator and reference computation, supported by domain explanations, tighter-setting comparisons, independent ODE checks, and analytical limiting-case evidence. |
| 27 | `category_and_tags` | **PASS** | code+model | Science and Physics accurately identify the primary domain, and the tags specifically describe kinetic theory, gas mixtures, thermal diffusion, quantum scattering, and phase shifts. |
| 28 | `task_name` | **PASS** | code+model | The descriptive slug chapman-enskog-transport is lowercase kebab-case with exactly three tokens and matches the declared task name. |
| 29 | `task_readme` | **PASS** | code+model | The README contains all required sections and supplies useful, code-consistent scientific, verification, and maintenance context rather than merely duplicating the instruction. |
| 30 | `task_toml_schema` | **PASS** | code | all 24 checks pass or do not apply (24 decided by code, 0 by the model) |
| 31 | `no_extraneous_files` | **PASS** | code+model | Every supplied file serves task configuration, environment construction, the oracle, reference-value generation and validation, grading, documentation, or the targeted anti-cheat control. |
| 32 | `ctrf_reporting` | **PASS** | code+model | The five pytest checks emit CTRF that root copies to /logs/verifier/ctrf.json, and early grading failures receive a per-test fallback report. |

## Realism

| # | Criterion | Outcome | Method | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 33 | `interesting` | **PASS** | code+model | A reference transport-property calculator is credible paid scientific software work for groups validating low-temperature gas-property libraries, even though the specified molecular family is an idealized model. |

## Novelty

| # | Criterion | Outcome | Method | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 34 | `novel` | **NOT_PROVIDED** | code (originality) | evidence not provided: originality: deferred to the full review: the quick check does not search originality (the full review runs tb4 originality and judges novel) |

## Agentic

| # | Criterion | Outcome | Method | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 35 | `agentic` | **PASS** | code+model | Developing a reliable solver for this contract requires iterative numerical experiments, resonance diagnosis, limiting-case checks, debugging, and performance profiling rather than simple recall or a single terminal command. |

## Structured review

Methods: 2 by code, 33 by one model question with code checks, 0 by one model question. A code check fails a criterion only on present, current evidence; a check without its record is not provided (the model's verdict stands). A code verdict is never the model's.
